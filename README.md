# Machine Learning Module in Pure Python: Data Science Tools without Numpy or Scipy or SKLearn

![Machine Learning Module Pure Python](https://github.com/ThomIves/MachineLearningModulePurePy/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Module_Repo.png)
> This is a module of machine learning tools for data science using pure python WITHOUT numpy, scipy or sklearn and is covered in greater detail across several blog posts from ![Integrated Machine Learning & AI Blog](https://integratedmlai.com)

Our goal is to better understand principles of machine learning tools by exploring how to code them ourselves  without using the **AWESOME** python modules available for machine learning such as numpy, scipy, sklearn, etc.

We hope that these tools **will** provide insights and better understanding into machine learning and AI principles. If you've come here initially, we hope that you will explore the ![blog](https://integratedmlai.com) and follow it's posts on using the other repositories.
